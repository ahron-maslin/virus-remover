# virus-remover
Another batch script I developed to remove the pestering "shortcut virus" - an annoying virus that copies itself to every device that is infected. The virus will hide all of your files, and replace the with shortcuts that simultaneously open file, but also copies the virus to any other device. This batch script will unhide all of the files, and completely remove the virus from the infected computer and any specified mass storage device.


# Usage
When the script starts, it will automatically check if the virus is on the computer and remove it if necessary. Afterwards, the user can input a drive letter associated with any other affected mass storage device and the script will remove the virus.
